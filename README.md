# rusty-reactor

> This project is still in active development and as such is currently **not functional** and will not be 'generally available' for others to play about with until version `1.0.0`.  Please check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/West-DevOps/projects/4/views/2) for details about upcoming features and fixes but as this is a personal learning project *there is no release date* for `1.0.0`.

Playground learning rust by modelling (not scientifically at all) a nuclear power plant, based around the `rand` crate to determine nuclear decay. 

## Installing / Running

Ensure you have `rust` toolchain already installed then you can download the `latest`
release and install globally directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-reactor) with the following command:

```

Precompiled binaries are not available at this time, i.e. you must have the `rust` toolchain preinstalled to run this project.
